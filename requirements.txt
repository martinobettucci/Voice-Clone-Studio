openai-whisper; sys_platform == 'win32'  # Windows only - Linux/macOS use VibeVoice ASR instead

# Optional performance enhancements (install separately for best performance):
# - Flash Attention 2 (fast): pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

# Note for Linux users:
# - If onnxruntime fails to install, try the nightly build:
# - openai-whisper is excluded due to compatibility issues (llvmlite/numba build failures)
# - VibeVoice ASR can be used for transcription instead
